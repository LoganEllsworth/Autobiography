## Welcome to my autobiographical website!
I created this as a personal project after completing my AWS CCP certification to cement the knowledge I acquired during the learning process, and to demonstrate my skills building full stack application. The majority of my experience is with JavaScript, React, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL. I also have another personal project utilizing React-Native for a mobile application, and experience building web-apps with ASP.NET.

## How its made
This will outline the tech stack used for this application as well as the reasoning behind my choices.

### Tech Stack
- React.js (and Material UI)
- Express
- AWS Lambda
- AWS DynamoDB
- AWS Amplify

### Reasoning
I have found that the both the majority of my professional experience, as well as one of the more common job requirements is JavaScript and/or various JS libraries. I elected to reinforce my current experience but using the latest and greatest, as well as functional components instead of class components as has been the majority of my experience.

I elected to use Material UI for this project. Previously I have had experience with Bootstrap and Ant Design, and wanted to expand on those experiences with a new library.

For the AWS services, my RESTful API is a serverless offering provided using AWS Lambda. The database is created using AWS DynamoDB, another serverless offering, which is a NoSQL database as opposed to my primary experience with PostgreSQL. The client is hosted using AWS Amplify finishing off the synergy between the 3 services.
